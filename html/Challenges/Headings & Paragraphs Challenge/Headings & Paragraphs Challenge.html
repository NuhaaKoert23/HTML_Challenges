    <h1>Maxims of Baloo</h1>

    <h2>All that is</h2>
    <p>...told here happened some time before
Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or
revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the
days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle.
The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so
quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as
much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own
pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat
the Hunting Verse —‘Feet that make no noise; eyes that
can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their
lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks
of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena
whom we hate.’ But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a
great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black
Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see
how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head
against a tree while Mowgli recited the day’s lesson to
Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could
swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo,
the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how
to speak politely to the wild bees when he came upon a
hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang
the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday;
and how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he
splashed down among them. None of the Jungle People
like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at an
intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers’
Hunting Call, which must be repeated aloud till it is
answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts
outside his own grounds. It means, translated, ‘Give me
leave to hunt here because I am hungry.’ And the answer
is, ‘Hunt then for food, but not for pleasure.’  </p>

<h3>All this will</h3>
    <p>...show you how much Mowgli had to learn
by heart, and he grew very tired of saying the same thing
over a hundred times. But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one
day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a
temper, ‘A man’s cub is a man’s cub, and he must learn all
the Law of the Jungle.’ </p>

<h4>'But think how</h4>
<p>small he is,’ said the Black Panther,
who would have spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own
way. ‘How can his little head carry all thy long talk?’ </p>

<h5>'Is there anything</h5>
<p>...in the jungle too little to be killed?
No. That is why I teach him these things, and that is why
I hit him, very softly, when he forgets.’
‘Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Ironfeet?’
Bagheera grunted. ‘His face is all bruised today by
thy— softness. Ugh.’</p>

<h6>'Better he should</h6>
<p>...be bruised from head to foot by me
who love him than that he should come to harm through
ignorance,’ Baloo answered very earnestly. ‘I am now
teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall
protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all
that hunt on four feet, except his own pack. He can now
claim protection, if he will only remember the words,
from all in the jungle. Is not that worth a little beating?’</p>
