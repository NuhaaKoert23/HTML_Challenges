    <p><i>First, let me introduce myself. My name is Nuhaa Daniels, I am currently studying full stack developing for Life Choices by the help of CodeSpace. We are currently in week 2 since the program has started.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><i>This may sound like very little experience, but yet during this 2 weeks we have, or should i say I have learnt a lot of HTML and a small bit of CSS. This is because I didnt have much background with programming and only had "Computer Literate" skills. I have no tertiary education on programming and no experience at all. All I have is the passion for programming and now is finally able to live one of my Dreams.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><i>I'll start off my journey with what went wrong. Getting to the basics, I needed to find out and do research on HTML in order to know the basics.With the help of cheatsheets and some useful websites.
    As I went through my lessons and challenges I had plenty of mistakes, it was up to me to go and fix my mistakes so that I could understand them and not do it again instead of coping the answer from a peer.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><i>My mistake was to stay absent, it meant that I was now behind with my challenges and so the biggest challenge was to catch up. Being behind meant that I had to isolate myself from the class in order for me to catch up, it was a lonely walk. Thank god I was able to catch up more than what i was suppose to so that played and important role to me.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><i>I am proud of what I have done thus far and I'm curious and excited to move on to the next stage already.</i></p>
